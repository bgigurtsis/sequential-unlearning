## 2026-11-01: from teaching a biography to erasing what Gemma already knows

Status: Billy's 1 November 2026 edits are included below. He then funded
RunPod and asked the manager to run the pilot.

**What changed.**

- **Target.** The project stops teaching a fictional biography and then
  removing an episode. It now targets knowledge that gemma-3-4b-it already has,
  starting with one stand-in everyday concept.
- **Framing.** Either denial or loss is acceptable, and Billy will choose after
  the pilot. Denial means the model is trained not to say it, while an internal
  readout shows it still recognises the answer. Loss means the knowledge is gone
  from the weights and the model can't say it.
- **Hard limits.** Billy set these on 1 November 2026.
  - A visitor can't easily get around the removal by talking about the
    neighbourhood. For example, if the submission is "forget my ex", asking
    about boyfriends or relationships must not bring it back.
  - The model doesn't produce gibberish, on the target or anywhere else.
    Refusals, "I can't remember", confusion and short fragments are acceptable.
    Incoherent text and runaway loops are not.
  - Billy accepts that these limits pull against each other. He also accepts
    that forgetting something the model was never specifically taught is hard.
- **The bar.** Billy set it on 1 November 2026.
  - Curious visitors, guided by suggested prompts, cannot get the concept back
    by asking about it directly, indirectly, or by implication. A few
    determined jailbreakers are out of scope.
  - Nearby topics may fade. For "my ex", weddings or love songs may degrade.
    Distant topics such as weather, cooking, maths and directions must stay
    useful.
  - The model using something the visitor explains in the conversation does
    not count as recovery. Only knowledge the model adds counts.
  - Output filters, keyword blocks and persona prompts do not count as
    forgetting.
  - The 30 submissions are collected before the show and tested before it
    opens.
- **Next step.** One pilot on one stand-in concept, comparing four approaches
  on the same frozen questions:
  - A: trained "I can't remember"
  - B: UNDO, which suppresses, adds noise and distills on filtered text
  - E: attention-head lesion
  - F: SAE clamp at runtime

  The plan is `docs/ERASURE_PILOT_PLAN_20261101.md`.
- **Compute.** RunPod Community Cloud, inside a hard spending limit.

**Why.**

- **Billy's view.** Implanting a memory and then removing it is bookkeeping,
  not loss.
- **Our own record.** Every suppression we tested broadly leaked on questions
  that imply the target without naming it. Our clean selective removal of
  whole concepts never passed.
- **The literature.** The September and October 2026 update
  (`docs/litreview/UPDATE_20261101_SEP_OCT.md`) shows the field finding the
  same leaks. It also shows no follow-up to UNDO, which leaves a pilot
  informative.

**What is abandoned or paused.**

- **The biography teach-then-remove route.** This includes the frozen but
  never-launched E2 reference job. All of it is archived on the E: SSD and
  stays there unchanged.
- **The tight boundaries.** The earlier acceptance rules required protected
  neighbours and clean selectivity. The new bar replaces them. Old results
  keep their old verdicts.
- **The broad employment work.** No further runs.

**What would reverse this.**

- **All four pilot approaches fail the curious-visitor bar on the stand-in
  concept.** Then reconsider narrow event targets, or removable-expert
  methods on a mixture-of-experts model (REX on Gemma 4 26B-A4B).
- **Billy decides the piece needs participant-given memories after all.**
  Then the biography route returns. Billy is open to either direction,
  depending on what the pilot shows.
